Description: Sugar Learning Platform - labyrinth mind-mapping activity
 Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through Sugar
 Activities that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality
 education.  Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar
 offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.
 .
 Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.  They are software
 packages that automatically save your work - producing specific
 instances of the Activity that can be resumed at a later time.  Many
 Activities support learner collaboration, where multiple learners may
 be invited to join a collective Activity session.
 .
 Labyrinth is a lightweight mind-mapping activity based on an Open Source
 project called Labyrinth. It allows creating mind maps from a mixture of
 text, freehand drawings, and images from your Journal. There is an infinite
 sized canvas for your map that can be panned and zoomed while you work. Maps
 can be "Kept to PDF" for uploading to web sites, sharing, and printing by
 others who may not be using Sugar.
